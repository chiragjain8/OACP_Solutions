# ALGORITHM
The algorithm used in the code to find the maximum product subarray is based on dynamic programming and keeps track of both the maximum and minimum products ending at each index. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how the algorithm works:

### Initialization:

Initialize variables max_product, min_product, and result to the first element of the input array nums[0].
max_product stores the maximum product ending at the current index.
min_product stores the minimum product ending at the current index.
result stores the maximum product subarray encountered so far.
### Loop through the array:

Start the loop from index 1 (since we initialized the variables with the first element).
For each element nums[i] in the array:
If nums[i] is negative, swap max_product and min_product. This is done because multiplying a negative number with a maximum product can make it the minimum product, and vice versa.
Update max_product and min_product based on whether nums[i] is greater than or less than the current product multiplied by nums[i].
Update result with the maximum of result and max_product.
### Return the result:

After the loop ends, result will contain the maximum product of a subarray in the input array nums.
Return result.
