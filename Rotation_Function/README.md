# Algorithm

### Initialization:

Initialize variables sum and rotation to 0. sum will store the sum of all elements in nums, and rotation will store the rotation function F(0).
Initialize max_rotation to rotation initially.
### Calculate F(0):

Loop through the elements of nums from index 0 to n-1.
In each iteration, add the product of the index and the value at that index to rotation. This calculates the rotation function F(0) according to the given formula.
### Find Maximum Rotation:

Initialize a loop from k = 1 to n-1. This loop represents the number of rotations.
In each iteration of the loop:
Update rotation using the formula rotation = rotation + sum - n * nums[n - k].
This formula represents the rotation function F(k) based on the previous rotation function F(k-1) and the sum of the elements in the array.
Update max_rotation if the current rotation is greater than max_rotation.
### Return Maximum Rotate Value:

After the loop ends, max_rotation will contain the maximum rotate value encountered.
Return max_rotation.
